# Springboot-Apis

I created 2 Spring Boot applications,
1. To perform CRUD operations using Employee details and using mongoDB as the database in the backend. Also used redis cache to retrieve frequently used data.
2. To perform the working of RabbitMQ messaging broker using Transaction rest api showing both publishing and consuming of data. 

Technologies used:
1. Spring Boot
2. MongoDB
3. Redis cache
4. Postman
5. RabbitMQ
6. Spring Cloud Stream
